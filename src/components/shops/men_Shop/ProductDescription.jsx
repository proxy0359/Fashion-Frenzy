        The Kenwyn is a fisherman inspired knitted jumper with a classic Breton
        stripe design, based on old French navy uniforms. Knitted from our
        organic cotton/recycled polyester blend, it's an easy throw-on piece
        that provides a touch of extra warmth as we get through the changeable
        weather of spring, with a high neckline to keep the chill off

        This product is made with CiCLOÂ®, an innovative solution that
        accelerates the safe breakdown of plastic fibres in soil and sea,
        ultimately reducing fugitive microplastics in the environment.
