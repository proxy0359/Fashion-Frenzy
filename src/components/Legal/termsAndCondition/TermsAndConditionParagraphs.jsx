      <p>
        By entering the Fashion Frenzy website you agree to abide by the Terms
        and Conditions of use. A placement of an order online indicates your
        acceptance of these Terms & Conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Orders shall be accepted at our sole discretion but will normally be
        accepted if the goods that you order are available and your credit card
        is authorised for the transaction. Your card will be charged
        automatically when you place your order. If for any reason we are unable
        to fulfill your order, a full refund will be given.
      </p>
      <p>
        The contract between us (Fashion Frenzy) and you (the customer) becomes
        binding when we send you an invoice (with your goods). You will own the
        goods once they have been delivered to the address specified and when we
        have received cleared payment for the goods in full. Until that time
        then we will retain title to the goods. We will contact you if there are
        any problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prices quoted to you are the prices set at the time. If for any reason
        they are increased we will let you know by e-mail and inform you prior
        to processing your order. We will accept your order when we send you an
        invoice with your goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do try to ensure the pictures of the goods on our website are
        accurate. However, there may be slight variations in colour and texture
        between the pictures and the goods themselves.
